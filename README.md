## Concept
A wave-based co-op space ship combat game created for the Alt Cntrl Game Jam. The players control a ship moving through an asteroid field with enemies spawning and attacking them.

The game used 2 player co-op:
- Player 1 controls ship movement and is responsible for recharging energy
- Player 2 controls the turret and is responsible for shooting and shielding against enemy projectiles

Different weaons like a shotgun, machine gun and laser can be used on the player as well as the enemies that spawn based on dificulty.

## Tech
Shader graph was used for the shield and projectiles.

The controls were implemented on an arduino and later adapted to the keyboard and mouse.

Control was maintained through a series of knobs and buttons.

An LED matrix was used to display the thrust, orientation and current shield and health values.

## Controls
W, S to control the thrust
A, D to control orientation
R to recharge energy
Mouse to aim
Left Click to fire
Right Click to shield
